title: Hi, I am Murat!
---

I am a software engineer working at <span class='company'><b>g</b>etir</span>, designing tools and experiences around container-based platforms.

Over the course of my career, I have developed notable open source tools with strong adoption in the cloud-native infrastructure space, around Kubernetes and serverless containers.

I was worked on the <a href="https://virtualmetric.com">VirtualMetric</a> project â€”the Makefile for the cloud-native world. Prior to that, I worked on the Cloud Run and Kubernetes (GKE).

If you happen to speak Turkish, check out my YouTube channel, where I explain modern infrastructure and cloud-native technologies in simpler words.

## Recent open source projects

I build open source tools that help hundreds of thousands of developers around the world as part of my job. You can find them on my GitHub profile:
